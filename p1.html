<li>Early mainframe-centric computing was sometimes provisioned with remote access over modem-based, or dial-up, landline connections, typically at 300 to 1,200 bits per second. Subscriber devices, in this case, were terminals only, usually Teletypes or their CRT-based equivalents. Mobile terminals appeared during this era, and although they were much larger, heavier and more expensive than today's mobile computers, and network speeds remained slow, mobile -- at the time, nomadic-only -- computing quickly gained popularity.The development of initial mobile computers in the late 1970s centered on sewing machine-size PCs -- e.g., the Osborne 1 and the Compaq Portable -- based on early operating systems, such as CP/M and MS-DOS. Featuring floppy disks, small monochrome CRT displays and, when available, plug-in (RJ-11) modems of up to 2,400 bps, these nomadic devices still required AC power.
Similarly, early laptop computers -- most notably the first, the GRiD Systems Compass Computer 1101 -- also required AC power and were large, heavy and expensive. Early laptops quickly gained popularity, especially with the refinement to the smaller notebook form factor and the inclusion of add-on and eventually internal Wi-Fi links, reliable battery power, contemporary operating systems -- Microsoft Windows, MacOS and Linux -- improved displays and reduced prices.</li>
